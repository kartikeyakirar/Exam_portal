A disclaimer is generally any statement intended to specify or delimit the scope of rights <br/>
and obligations that may be exercised and enforced by parties in a legally recognized relationship. <br/>
In contrast to other terms for legally operative language, the term disclaimer usually implies situations<br/>
that involve some level of uncertainty, waiver, or risk.<br/>
