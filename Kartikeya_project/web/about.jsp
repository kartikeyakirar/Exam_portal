<p>
Examination Hub is a web application that helps in establishing a network between the institutes and the
students. Institutes enter into this site and answer the questions they want in the exam. The questions are
displayed as a test to the students. The answers entered by the students are then evaluated and
their score is calculated and saved. This score then can be easily accessed by the institutes so that they can easily determine the
score of the students in order to evaluate their performance.
</p>
<p>
Examination Hub provides the platform but does not directly participate in, nor is it involved in
any tests conducted. Questions are posted by the users of the site. This site requires an
institute to register before posting the questions.
</p>
<p>
 This application is developed by using J2EE technology and related database.
